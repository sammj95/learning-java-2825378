Control flow statements: evaluate to true or false
- if statements

Relational operators: < > == >= <= !=

Errors
- syntax: code fails before the program is run
- logical: code doesn't act as the user expects

Debugger
- breakpoint: halts the program to inspect its internal state
- step in: go into next method and continue debugging step by step
- step over: execute next method as one entire step
- step return: breaks out of step by step debugging and returns as one entire step
- resume: back to normal debugging instead of step by step

Functions
- series of steps to accomplish a task
- called methods in Java (and object-oriented programming)
- return types
- dot operator: access provider for function, class, or instance of a class

Classes
- user defined blueprint of attributes/properties and behaviors/methods
- instance: object created from a class
- constructor: initializes instances of a class
  - "new" keyword
- this becomes a new data type

  - static/class methods do not require an instance
- instance variables are tied to an instance of a class
  - static variables are the same for the entire class (aka every instance)
